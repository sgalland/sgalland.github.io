# Scheme
Scheme is a dialect of the Lisp (List Processing) programming language. Scheme has been used for decades to teach the fundamentals of programming at universities such as Berkley and MIT, et al. One of the most popular courses on programming is [Berkley's CS61A](../../cs/programming/cs61a.html) which uses the book Structures Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP) as it's textbook.



## Structured Interpretation of Computer Programs
Structured Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP) is a book published by MIT Press, authored by Harold Abelson, Gerald J. Sussman, and Julie Sussman. The book introduces fundamental principles of computer programming, such as creating abstractions with procedures and data, modularity, and understanding computation. It uses a Lisp-derived language called Scheme. Within the hacking community, the book is affectionately known as the "Wizard Book."

In order to do the programming exercises I recommend using [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) with the [SICP Collection](https://docs.racket-lang.org/sicp-manual/index.html). Alternatively, on UNIX-like systems (Linux, BSD, macOS) you can install the MIT-Scheme interpreter and use your own choice of editor.

## How to Design Programs
Need to do more research on this book. Looks beginner friendly and uses Racket as well.
