There are two versions of this course from Berkley and one course from MIT. The modern version is taught by John DeNero using Python. The older Berkley course was taught by Brian Harvey using MIT Scheme. The oldest course by MIT is based on the first edition of Structures and Interpretation of Computer Programs. While both courses are well known, the older course was considered transformational. If you struggle with the older course, take DeNero's course and come back to Harvey's class later on. Below is information on how to get started with either course.
