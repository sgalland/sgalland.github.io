{{ page.subtitle }} (SICP) is a book written from MIT Press written by Harold Abelson, Gerald J. Sussman, and Julie Sussman. The book focuses on teaching the fundamental principles of computer programming, such as building abstractions with procedures and data, modularity, and how computation works using a Lisp derived language called Scheme. The book is known as the "Wizard Book" within the hacking community.

There are two Berkley courses listed and one MIT course. The Berkley course taught by Brian Harvey is a famous course using the SICP book. The other one with the same name but is a completely different course taught by DeNero, covering similar topics using Python. The last course is from MIT covering content from the first edition of the SICP book. While there are some differences, the content covered in the 1st and 2nd editions are primarily the same, you should be able to use the 2nd edition book to follow along.

While the book is a bit difficult many consider it a transformational experience. however if you are struggling the DeNero course is suggested and takes a more modern approach. DeNero's course uses his own book [Composing Programs](https://www.composingprograms.com/).

There are two versions of this course from Berkley and one course from MIT. The modern version is taught by John DeNero using Python. The older Berkley course was taught by Brian Harvey using MIT Scheme. The oldest course by MIT is based on the first edition of Structures and Interpretation of Computer Programs. While both courses are well known, the older course was considered transformational. If you struggle with the older course, take DeNero's course and come back to Harvey's class later on. Below is information on how to get started with either course.
