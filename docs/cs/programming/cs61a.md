{{ page.subtitle }} (SICP) is a book published by MIT Press, authored by Harold Abelson, Gerald J. Sussman, and Julie Sussman. The book introduces fundamental principles of computer programming, such as creating abstractions with procedures and data, modularity, and understanding computation. It uses a Lisp-derived language called Scheme. Within the hacking community, the book is affectionately known as the "Wizard Book."

There are two Berkeley courses and one MIT course associated with SICP. The first Berkeley course, taught by Brian Harvey, is a well-known offering that uses the SICP textbook. The second Berkeley course shares the same name but is taught by John DeNero. While it covers similar topics, it uses Python and DeNero's own textbook, [Composing Programs](https://www.composingprograms.com/). The final course is an MIT offering that covers material from the first edition of the SICP book. While there are some differences between the first and second editions, the content is largely similar, so the second edition can still be used to follow along.

Though SICP can be challenging, many consider it a transformational experience. However, if you find it difficult, the DeNero course is a recommended alternative, as it offers a more modern approach to the material.
