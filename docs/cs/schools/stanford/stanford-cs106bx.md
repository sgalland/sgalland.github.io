{: .note }
This is an accelerated version of [CS106B: Programming Abstractions](./stanford-cs106b.md) and is normally taken an as alternative to the base class, although since you aren't paying tuition it's great for the repetition of CS106B contents. If you want to get better at C++ programming, consider [CS106L](./stanford-cs106l.md).
